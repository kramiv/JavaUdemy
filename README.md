"Java Programming Masterclass covering Java 11 &amp; 17" on Udemy. Course notes and exercises

Goal: complete 1 hour of video material per day. 

I have been working slower than I would like because my January-term class course is difficult and requires a lot of practice and time.

After completing a section, go over my typed notes taken during the videos (in the files) and write down new concepts by hand into my notebook.

Projects completed in IntelliJ community version.
